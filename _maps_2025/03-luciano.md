Philadelphia’s zoning pattern reveals the city’s spatial structure —
RSA (single-family), RM (multi-family), and CMX (commercial mixed-use) districts dominate the urban fabric,
reflecting a gradient from dense residential cores to suburban peripheries.
Data sourced from the City of Philadelphia’s Planning Department, processed and visualized using {sf} and {ggplot2} in R.

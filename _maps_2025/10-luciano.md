This thematic map visualizes the global air-traffic network originating from **Cairo International Airport (CAI)**.  
Countries are colored by the number of connected airports, with darker greens indicating denser connections.  
Flight paths are drawn as great-circle arcs, revealing Cairo’s centrality as a hub bridging Africa, the Middle East, and Europe.  
The visualization highlights both geographic reach and the asymmetry of global air connectivity — where aviation networks mirror economic and regional interdependence.

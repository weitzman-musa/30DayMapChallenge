This map illustrates the temporal layering of Utrecht’s built environment, where each color represents a period of construction — from medieval cores to 21st-century developments.
Older neighborhoods cluster around the historic center, while expansion radiates outward through successive centuries, tracing the city’s evolution and spatial morphology.
The visualization uses a dark basemap to highlight the vibrant chronology of urban growth, symbolizing how time and space weave together in the city’s form.

---

This map is an experiment with **Felt as a new mapping tool**, re-drawing the
confessional geography of Central Europe. Each polygon represents a territory
and is coloured by its dominant religion:

- **Dark green** – Catholicism  
- **Light green** – Catholic Church (ecclesiastical territories)  
- **Pink** – Lutheranism  
- **Purple** – Calvinism  
- **Grey** – Other / mixed

Together these patches form a dense religious mosaic: a broad Catholic bloc in
the Habsburg lands and Poland–Lithuania, Lutheran territories stretching
across northern Germany and Scandinavia, and smaller Calvinist pockets in the
German southwest and Low Countries. Large grey areas mark territories that do
not fit neatly into a single confession in the underlying dataset.

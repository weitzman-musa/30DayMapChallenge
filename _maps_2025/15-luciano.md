This sprint map shows **recently active volcanoes across Southeast Asia**, limited to Holocene volcanoes with eruptions recorded since 1925.  
Each point is a volcano, with symbol size keyed to the **recency of its last known eruption** (1950, 1975, 2000 in the legend).

The pattern reveals the tight clustering of active systems along **Indonesia’s volcanic arc**, with additional chains in the **Philippines** and **Mariana Islands**. The map emphasises how densely the region’s major population centres sit along active plate boundaries.

**Cartography**
- Basemap: simplified land polygons for Southeast Asia in a warm, low-contrast tone; no borders or labels to keep focus on the arc geometry.  
- Symbols: solid red circular markers for volcanoes, sized by last eruption year to hint at temporal intensity while keeping the palette minimal.  
- Layout: a wide regional frame that captures the whole Sunda arc; a compact legend in the corner explaining eruption-year size classes; succinct two-line title highlighting both geography and time window.

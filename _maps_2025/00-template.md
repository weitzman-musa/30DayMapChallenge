By default, your thumbnail will be displayed here. If that's good enough, cool, just delete all of this text below the front matter.

But if you want to give any context for your map, feel free to all the **power** of [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to do so here. If you do, just make sure to also include some image(s) of your project, e.g.:

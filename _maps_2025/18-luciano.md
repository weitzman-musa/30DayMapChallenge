For the **“Out of this world”** theme I mapped a fictional continent,
*New Columbria*: a vaguely Atlantic-looking landmass that could have been
Columbus’s “other New World”. The coastline was sketched by hand, converted to
polygons in Python, and then labelled with a small set of port cities  
(**New Lancaster, Rotonro, Landattle, St Luciano, Medelliburg, Portma,
Bucharestana**) plus the **Gulf of Mayerson**.  

The result is a clean, almost old-atlas style base map that hints at trade
routes and future exploration without tying itself to any real geography.

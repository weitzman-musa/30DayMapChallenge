This map compares the Caspian Sea’s present water extent (2025, baseline −28 m) with a 2125 projection under a constant drop rate (≈0.10 m/yr).
Two uniform blues show the retreat: light = 2025, deep = 2125. Land is shown with soft hypsometric tints and gentle hillshade. Key coastal cities—Baku, Aktau, and Bandar Anzali—anchor the narrative of shrinking shorelines and shifting ports.

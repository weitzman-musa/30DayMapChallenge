This map traces the vast railway network spanning the Russian Federation — a steel web connecting Europe and Asia across eleven time zones.
Each line’s thickness reflects its relative weight or importance, forming a rhythmic pattern of density that echoes the country’s geography: thick trunks radiating from Moscow, thinning into delicate threads across Siberia and toward the Pacific.

Based on my Google Location History,  
this interactive world map visualizes the places I have visited and lived between 2022–2025.  
Red points represent **home cities** (Philadelphia, London, Amsterdam, Hefei),  
while blue points mark **visited destinations** across Europe, Asia, and North America.  
Dashed lines connect each home city to its label on the oceans,  
creating a static global perspective of personal mobility —  
a spatial diary of movement and belonging.

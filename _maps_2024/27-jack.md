This is Memorial West Park in Vancouver, a park that I have lived next to since 2014, and this map was created to get revenge at a mapping project that I failed in grade 5. To recreate the amenities in the park as accurate as possible, I referred to the geojson maps and created these polygons by hand. I do feel that the coloring of the map is quite bland, and so to spice it up and create a dichotomy, I wanted to use an extremely fancy text. Of course, there is a lot on the screen, but it highlights how many activities there are at this very small park.

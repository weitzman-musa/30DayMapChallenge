I had the honour of going to many different countries in the world, and I wanted to see exactly how many countries I've been to. Of course, certain countries I travel to and from all the time, and they are distinguished from the ones I have been to only once. Using the Gestalt principles, I highlight which countries fall into which categories, and helps to better visualize these countries.

For the typography map, it was really hard thinking of an idea to focus on only texts. I opted to look at the ramen shops in Vancouver, and by purposefully making the background darker colored while the text is brighter, it brings the focus specifically on these typography. Additionally, Different text fonts are used to distinguish the type of text, whether if it is a street, a ramen shop, the title, or the subtitle.

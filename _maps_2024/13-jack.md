For the new tool map, I wanted to try making a 3D map. In fact, I was going to make a second 3D map originally, but this was very time consuming and so I kept this extremely simple map for the new tool map. This is a map of Niigata and Nagano Prefectures in Japan, which is the home of the largest river in the Country, alongside many other rivers, too. Simply put, this is a map of the river in the two regions, and additionally elevation is shown as well to capture the 3d element.

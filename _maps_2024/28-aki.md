I grew up in the Midwest, so I wanted to showcase the Great Lakes for today's map challenge. With it also being Thanksgiving (a holiday that whitewashes this country's genocidal history), I wanted to acknowledge the people that lived on the land before colonization.

Finding and mapping data regarding where Indigenous Americans lived proved to be much more challenging than expected. I pulled information from multiple sources and estimated locations of different tribes to the best of my ability based on available information.

Check out this [cool website](https://native-land.ca/) that visualizes indigenous peoples around the world.

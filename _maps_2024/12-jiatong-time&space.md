This map visualizes the territorial changes of the Qing Dynasty, comparing two significant years in its history:

- 1820 (25th year of Jiaqing - 嘉慶二十五年): The Qing Dynasty's territory was at its peak, but the nation's strength began to decline (嘉道中衰).

- 1911 (3rd year of Xuantong - 宣統三年): By this time—the final year of the dynasty—foreign powers had seized large portions of land, and the empire’s borders were significantly reduced.

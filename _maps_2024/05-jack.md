This is the journey of a bunch of internet celebrities that I might be a little bit too obsessed with. Regardless, they had recently did a sponsored video where they have to go to different locations in LA, finish tasks, and the first team to finish all tasks wins the challenge! So, using some of my art and the art they had in the video, I created the following map. Using color to represent which team was ahead during the journey, as well as images to describe the tasks and highlight the team, I displayed the journey in a very simple manner. The one thing that might be confusing is that even though Team Rocket arrived at the final destination first, Team Pikachu won because they finished the task first.

Please do not copystrike me.

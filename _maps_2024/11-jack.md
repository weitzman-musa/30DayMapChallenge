For the arctic map, I wanted to revisit an old friend of mine: Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI). I wanted to find a way to get NDSI data and map the NDSI for an Arctic region, and truly see how much snow there is. Luckily, it would seem that there is still a lot of snow in Nunavut, and even the water was frozen when the tif image was created. This data was actually collected through Google Earth Engine

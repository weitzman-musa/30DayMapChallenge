This was a difficult map to create, particularly more effort is needed to even attempt to recreate the vintage look in R. By georeferencing a 1913 map from the [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/maps_building_plans/record-details/fac6ffc2-115c-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad) in QGIS, the routes of tram services in Singapore are obtained.

It is a pity that these services were withdrawn some time before the Second World War. Would trams make a comeback in Singapore? Praying hard they would...
